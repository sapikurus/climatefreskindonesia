# PROJECT NAME: Climate Fresk Indonesia Visitor Sign-up

## About This Project

This web application is designed to collect contact information from visitors of the Climate Fresk quiz who are interested in being notified about future Climate Fresk sessions in Indonesia. 

## Purpose

The primary goal of this app is to build a network of individuals passionate about climate change awareness and education. By collecting visitor information, we can keep interested parties informed about upcoming Climate Fresk workshops and events.

Additionally, this digital solution aligns with Climate Fresk's commitment to environmental sustainability:

- By collecting data electronically, we significantly reduce our carbon footprint compared to traditional paper-based methods.
- This approach eliminates the need for printing materials, thus saving paper and reducing waste.
- Digital data collection and storage also simplify our administrative processes, making them more efficient and environmentally friendly.

## Data Collection and Privacy

We take the privacy of our visitors seriously. The data collected through this application includes:

- Name
- Organization (if applicable)
- Email address

### Our Commitment to Privacy

- The collected data will be treated with utmost care and respect for user privacy.
- We will not share, sell, or distribute this information to any third parties.
- The sole purpose of data collection is to inform users about future Climate Fresk workshops and related events.

## Technical Details

This web application is a simple, static site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Google Sheets as a backend to store the collected data securely.

## Development Notes

As an amateur developer, I built this webapp with the assistance of various online resources and AI tools. The project is open source, and I welcome any suggestions or contributions to improve its functionality and security.
